# Project-Asteroids
It's a reimagination of _Asteroids_ (1979) made with Pygame.

All sugestions are welcome :)

It was made with Pycharm and venv, that's why there are so many folders.

You can test by donwloading the exe (there's no malwares I swear) at _[dist](https://github.com/HugoPFe/Project-Asteroids/tree/main/Project_Asteroids/dist)_ folder.

All images files aren't being used, there's a file containg the base64 code for each image.
